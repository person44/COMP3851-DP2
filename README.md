## Running of code in the browser

Note that you will only need to do this once.

Afterwards, run:

localhost will start and you should be able to run the file in the browser.

If your browser does not automatically run the file, try the command again or open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
